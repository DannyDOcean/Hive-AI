Hive AI: Hopf Hive Neural Network (HHNN)
The Hopf Hive Neural Network (HHNN) is a next-generation neural network architecture designed to redefine AI. Inspired by recursive reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE), and high-dimensional embeddings, it aims to minimize resource usage while advancing toward AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).

GitHub Repository: Hive-AI by DannyDOcean

Features
Recursive Thinking: Nodes iteratively process inputs to simulate logical reasoning.
Mixture of Experts (MoE): Task-specific nodes reduce computational costs while improving efficiency.
Reasoning Agents: Integrates attention mechanisms and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
Hopf-inspired Depth: Processes data in high-dimensional latent spaces for complex problem-solving.
Self-Regulation: Dynamically optimizes its structure, learning, and improving autonomously.
